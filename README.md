# Qt_LLVM_App
JusForFun

This is a project where the user can write some c or c++ code in a editor. 

At the same time compilation is done every few seconds and compile output is presented in other window.

It uses a nice `QMarkDownTextEdit` widget including code highlight. Where the text height can be modified. And ```cpp ``` is removed from source.

It show's how the Gdb interface is used.
